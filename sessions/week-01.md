# Week 1

## Today, Monday 5th January 2015

1. Unit intro: [plan](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104#plan), key dates, [brief](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104#brief) and [assessment criteria](https://github.com/RavensbourneWebMedia/WEB14104#assessment-criteria)
* Draw *the Web*! 
* How does the WWW work?


# Draw *the Web*!	

But what do you mean by *the Web*? 

Imagine you have to explain what the Web is to an alien, or to your grandma. 

No need to make a technical drawing. It's more interesting (and more fun) if you **draw what the Web means to you** *personally*. 

#### Duration: ~30 minutes.

Then each *artist* presents their work to the class, adn together we discuss emerging **themes** (globe/planet, connections, computers, brands) and **metaphors/symbols** (clouds, trees, cats)


	
# How does it WWWork?

One of the emerging themes from your drawings *should* be that the WWW is a **Web of interlinked knowledge**, in constant evolution.

To put this concept into practice, let's pretend that each one of us is a `node` in a `network` of knowledge. Each node will hold information about a certain concept related to the WWW (for example: DNS, HTTP, IP address etc). 


[Using this collaborative Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NrRUySCy8CUf7Wrc4cbjwxsWh_fk6jXs47oMCnEljLk/edit?usp=sharing	) **research one key Web concept** and then explain it to your classmates. 

1. Each student picks one concept
2. You'll have about 1 hour to research (collect links and jot down your notes about your chosen concept)
3. Then 5 minutes to explain (~1 hour in total)


# Assignment for next week!

Remember to use the category **WEB1404** for all your blog posts for this unit!

1. Document your drawing of the Web on the blog. 

	Take a *good* picture (not wonky, sharp and clear) of your drawing and upload it to your 4F blog.
