#Recipe HTML & CSS Development

## Software

I used “Brackets” to input my code, which is open source licensed software free to download for both Windows and Mac OS. Created by Adobe ensured that it would be not only professional and capable of functions such as closing tags after creating them automatically, but also that the layout would be coherent in comparison to their other software packages. 
The choice in software was good in my opinion. Allowing me to implement both HTML and CSS to create a suitable web page. I decided to choose this software above its competitors such as Sublime Text and Coda due to its links to Adobe. But also as it is open source allowing a community to develop it and improve it over time. It is also cross platform across operating systems allowing me to contribute from both systems. 


## HTML
### Boilerplate
I used a boilerplate document in the process of writing the HTML code. This gave me a basic structure of the HTML document to save on time having to manually type in the necessary tags and elements. This allowed me to spend more time on the structure of the actual content. The boilerplate was from https://html5boilerplate.com/. It included tags such as <!DOCTYPE html>, <head></head and <body></body>. In the head tag it included many others such as the title of the page, its description etc. to help make the web page visible on search engines. 


### Resources

When coding, I used Lyndia.com tutorials from the course “HTML Essential Training with James Williamson”. I also used the book “HTML & CSS: Design and Build Web Sites” by John Duckett. These combined allowed me to develop what I learnt from the tutorials in lectures and experiment with additional things and improve structuring further that was true to what the industry follows. 

### Implications and Resolutions

One implication I found with the HTML coding was deciding what was necessary from the Boilerplate. This contained lots of information especially in the header part that was unnecessary in HTML 5 and was needed in previous versions. I used the online resources such as W3 Schools to research what were the key points. This allowed me to resolve the problem I faced and condensed the code to a more readable and organized format, which was clear to me, what each line did and was for. 

## CSS
I now needed to implement CSS into the document. This provides the HTML with sets of rules and styles, which can be applied to certain elements of the code to give it a different look and feel. 
I decided to follow popular web trends with a responsive webpage. This was possible through CSS. It allowed me to set a certain width to define such elements such as text sizes. The code below shows that at the width of 768px, it will change the background image to a relative position. It will also change the Heading 1, Heading 2, Heading 3 and paragraph sizes to fit better. I have also set it to change the columns of the Ingredients to change from 2 Columns to 1 when it reaches 768px wide.
A challenge I found with the CSS of the recipe was getting the spacing between elements right. Between the full-page header logo and the full page header image of the recipe, it created a small border of white space around each element. I tried to follow some online video tutorials on YouTube and Lyndia.com to resolve this. These didn’t work and the problem was resolved through my lecturer teaching me a way to fix this.## Grid Systems
For the recipe website I am going to use a grid system from Skeleton. This uses 12 columns across a page to create order, consistency and proportion across a website. This is used in Industry and therefore is important to implement it into the Recipe webpage.
The Skeleton Grid template contains CSS document which when linked to the HTML document can be changed and modified to suit the look and feel that I want to have for the page. Although I was pretty happy with my result from just the HTML and CSS before, It allows change to be easily done across the page and makes it a more efficient and organised process. 
I used Gridlover, which is a website that allowed me to insert the HTML code from the Recipe into the site and implement the sizing, margins and spacing. This gave me a feel for how it could be done and what looks best for the situation. Here is a screenshot of using my HTML code with Grid lover. There
