#Bad Website Overview

##Introduction

I will be reviewing three websites which I have seen and feel that for a number of reasons are bad. Looking from both an owners and users point of view, for each site, I can identify problems with the sites to point out their flaws. 
The sites will be reviewed based on their design and graphic content, and usability features. This includes loading time, navigation, and accessibility.

I will be looking at Jakob Nielsen's '10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design' principles to identify these weaknesses and review successfully.



##### The three websites that i will be reviewing are:

* [David Martin](#DavidMartin)
* [Ry X](#RYX)
* [Harry Seaton](#HarrySeaton)

### 1. <a name="DavidMartin"> David Martin </a>

#### Introduction
The David Martin website, in my opinion is a very bad site. From the looks, to the speed of the site and also the usability and navigation. These elements result in a badly put together website which could be bettered through a number of changes to improve the usability for the user. I will look at these weaknesses to identify areas for improvement which could be implemented if I was to use the David Martin site for my project.


#### Design
##### Background
The design of the David Martin website is very poor. This is due to a number of out dated designs such as the very cluttered background image which is a gradient spiral of blue. This from a users perspective, would make them feel like the site is untrustworthy due to its unprofessionalism. This then looks bad for the artist due to the bad reputation and presence given from his poorly designed website.

##### Fonts
Another poorly designed feature of the website is the use of a blue font as the body text for the whole site and also the headings. This is a poor design choice due to the fact the user will find it hard to read and is therefore likely to click off of the website.

###### Images
The three pages, other than the homepage,  on the website feature 3 images side by side of the artwork for his album. This is unnecessary to the website as I feel it makes it too cluttered and does not follow modern techniques of web design such as clean and simple design like many websites have become nowadays. This comes across as a desperate way to sell the album through e-commerce. Yet, there are more effective ways to sell through adverts to Spotify, iTunes, Amazon MP3 links etc and previews of the songs through Soundcloud and YouTube Music Videos to promote the product for the site to increase sales.

#### Usability
##### Speed
The speed of the website is very slow to a lot of the popular websites. This is a disadvantage both for the user and for the site owner. For the user, it is bad because it means the content that they want to access takes longer to load and this creates a bad experience at which they are likely to not return to the website again.
##### Search Bar

There is also no search bar on the website. This is a convention found on almost all website and the user knows to use this to find the information quickly and easily. Having no search bar can often lead to confusion on the website which creates a bad experience for the user. From a owners point of view, I understand that the lack of content is on the website so therefore may not be necessary, however is a nice feature to make the user feel comfortable with the website, even if it gets little usage.
##### Navigation

On the website there is a small amount of navigation. Although often it can be seen as negative due to having lack of content or no organisation leading to confusion. I feel the one route navigation system plays to the sites usability functionality despite it looking poor. There are four hyperlinks leading to the pages. It is simple and effective and also in the conventional position of at the top of the page so enable the user to easily navigate.

###2. <a name="RYX"> RY X </a>

#### Introduction
The RY X Website is for a artist signed with the record label,Dumont Dumont. He is based in California and has a hugely successful single 'Berlin'. From first impressions due to being a successful artist, it would appear for him to have a good website both in terms of the design and usability. I will be looking at the RY X Website in comparison to the '10 Usability Heuristics for User Interface Design' principles to give a review of the website.


#### Design
##### Navigational Bar

One feature to the website which I felt gave a negative impact to the site was the unclear design for the navigational bar. This has been done using small text at the bottom of the page. The text is hard to read and therefore may have some usability issues as well as the design problems. Also the underscores between the links act as a way to confuse the user as they are not sure if it is connected and just one link to a page or in-fact four. This is a bad aspect to the site and doesn't look appealing either. Also the placement of the navigational bar at the bottom is not convention and users are used to it being at the top of the page for them to easily click and navigate their way around the site.

##### Layout of Content
I also feel that there is consistently a bad layout across the homepage. The page relies on multimedia to be the bulk of content for the website. All images and videos are square or rectangles which should be simple to layout in an effective and clean look to reduce the amount of white space. Many amateur blogs on websites such as Tumblr use this grid blogging system as an effective way to show content using effective design. This website has unsuccessfully done this. There is lots of blank space and some overlapping of content. This looks highly unprofessional and should not be the case for this website.

##### Text Arrangement
Another design flaw with the site is the header of the page which says 'RY X' remains at the top of the page when scrolling in a parallax mode. This on some sites works great and can provide extra navigation or an extra purpose to the site for the user. However this just gets in the way. The problem is the RY X text has a transparent background meaning when there is text on the page it overlaps and makes it hard to read for the user which is a disadvantage.

#### Usability

##### Loading Time

One problem with the usability of the website is the speed at which it loads at. Due to the amount of multimedia elements on the homepage such as videos and images. This is bad for the user as it means that they become impatient with the content and are more likely to click off of the site. In the image below, it shows the loading of a video and shows how much the content lags on a page and the problems that occur.

##### External Links

On the navigational bar, there is no internal links and all links are external. These include social media sites such as Facebook and Soundcloud. Usually on a website it is conventional to use icons for social media as a way to allow people to visit the networks. It is rare to place it in a navigational bar and I don't feel like it works to the best of it's advantage. Another link on the navigational bar is the Shop. This is redirected to another website which looks unprofessional to users and may result in a  lack of trust of being redirected through different websites and services that they are unfamiliar with. Having an internal e-commerce service would be much more beneficial for the website and it's success to drive profits through online sales.

###3. <a name="HarrySeaton"> Harry Seaton </a>

#### Introduction
For my final review I shall be reviewing ways in which an Artist could improve their web presence to increase their fan base, ticket sales and e-commerce. Harry Seaton is an 18 year old Singer/Song Writer from King's Lynn, Norfolk. He has a large online following on his Twitter, his Facebook Pages and YouTube Channel. This has allowed him to travel the country and visit parts of the world to perform for fans. I will be looking at his current web presence and how a website and some features of the website could enhance his career. This will allow me to look at if creating a website for him would be most beneficial and challenging for the project.


#### Social Media Integration
Due to Harry Seaton having a large following from various social networking sites, it has allowed him to better his career as a singer songwriter. One element that is missing is a website. This allows a place to act as a hub to promote new products, singles, news and tour information for fans and those in the Music and Entertainment Industry.

I plan to integrate the use of social media into the website by allowing users to share the information on the site such as tour information. This will help promote the website and the artist to drive traffic and potential customers for the website to increase profits. I also would suggest to make a successful site to add content which is likely to be shared to people's social networking sites. The demographic for the website would be mainly females aged between 14-24, so therefore creating content specifically aimed at them would benefit the website and owner.


#### Multimedia Interactivity
Harry has many popular videos of both original songs and covers on YouTube. By using the multimedia element to the site would increase views on his videos and therefore advertising revenue may rise increasing profits. This also adds a more interactive element to the website allowing fans and even people who have never heard of him before to listen and benefit from a visual connection. This would aim to keep users on the website and therefore navigate exploring each page and potentially purchasing from the website.
