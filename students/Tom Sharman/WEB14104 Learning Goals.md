# Learning Goals: Web Development Workshop

### Introduction

This project will be a fundamental part of me beginning to understand to a greater complexity, the processes of website development. This is from the initial brain storming and planning through wireframes and mock-ups, to the design and implementation of testing and debugging which will be used on a public level, as well as maintaining the website and keeping it secure from threats and bugs through backing it up.
  

###Project Goals:

* __Improve Organisational Skills__ through using services such as Trello. Ensuring it is updated and checked to __Increase productivity.__
* __Develop Technical Abilities__ and skils in coding, primarely __HTML, CSS and PHP.__
* Create a further understanding of the processes of Web Development, such as, __Learn to debug and test a website to an industry standard.__

####Improving Organisational Skills

A key objective that I hope to achieve is to develop my organisational skills. As a student, I already feel that I have had good organisational skills both in previous projects on the course and as a creative professional, working with clients. This strength has been possible due to the introduction of Trello. It allowed me to create lists with sufficient detail such as the responsibilities, description and due date for each individual task. However, one personal limitation I have found is that I use it at the start of the process in the planning stage, but towards the end tend, often during the implementation stage, to move away from it. I hope from this project to continue using Trello, or other services that are similar, which will improve my project management to increase productivity and efficiency.

The article [*'Why We Moved From Basecamp to Trello'* ](http://outspokenmedia.com/online-marketing/why-we-moved-from-basecamp-to-trello/)by *Out Spoken Media* on their website, talks about their decision to migrate to Trello from other services they previously have used. This has inspired my choice to use this method and I admire their decision as creative professionals. 

####Developing Technical Skills

I hope to develop my technical abilities and skills in coding. HTML and CSS are the key languages used for websites. A limitation I have within the project is my lack of experience writing codes from scratch. This is due to having a lot more experience with design, which I have always focussed on. However, as a student, I understand the need to develop my skillset to make the transition to a creative professional that is working commercially. A way in which I can complete this objective is to use the resource ‘Lyndia.com’ for online tutorials, speaking and learning from my peers who have better abilities than myself at coding. I am currently reading a book called ***HTML&CSS: Design and build web sites* **by *Jon Duckett* to allow me to understand coding at a more advanced level. To help me achieve a better understanding, I will spend time watching, reading and experimenting with writing code to achieve my goal.

####Debugging and Testing a Website

My Final objective is to create a further understanding of the processes of website development, particularly at the end of the process. Thus meaning after the website creation, such as the testing and debugging, which so far I have had diminutive experience with, I hope from the direction from both peers and tutors, I can learn this vital skill. I want to develop my knowledge of maintaining a website through backing up files with Git Hub, allowing me to upload files as an open source. I feel that this is a great objective, in contrast with my design abilities, as I lack in this area of Web development. I aim to challenge a weakness that I have discovered by using online tutorials through Lynda.com, or having tutorials on a personal, as well as a group level, and both in Lectures and after lecture sessions to enable me to attain this objective.
